description: Detect when value function explains little of the return variance
trainers: [ppo, grpo]
metric: explained_variance
condition: "< 0.1"
window: 30

message: "Explained variance at {value:.3f} - value function is nearly useless. Consider more value function updates or larger critic."
reference: "Engstrom et al. (2020) 'Implementation Matters' - explained_variance < 0 means critic is worse than predicting mean"
